==========================

Pillaged by [FnB] RuudVanPistolrooy aka JamesL


This is a filthy rip off of [UPC] Psykoman's assault_UPC. I decompiled it, added in a bunch of new routes, fixed all the screwed up brushes and retextured the whole map with stuff stolen from half a dozen other cs maps. Yeah its a filthy rip but hey it was made in about 6 hours and was never intended to be a test of mapping skill(z) beyond bug fixing, rather it was simply something to make my clanmates happy over xmas.


This map has been made for the fragnbag.com servers and has 32 spawn points. It is best played with the matrix jumping mod enabled.
