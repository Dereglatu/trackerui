Snowy Day - Bomb Defusing
by corvalho (corvalho1@gmail.com)

Storyline: Terrorists attacked the cars 
of the American embassy during a trip to 
fetch confidential documents. Other 
cars have arrived to recover the documents 
and the Counter-Terrorists have been sent 
to help.

Counter-Terrorists: Protect the embassy cars, 
prevent the terrorists from bombing them.
If necessary, eliminate all terrorists.

Terrorists: These docs are about the localization
of your faction's HQ, and plans of attack. 
Don't let this docs, fall in Uncle Sam's hands. 
They were distributed between the two cars. 
Plant the bomb, near one of the embassy's cars 
to avoid that all of them arrive at their destination.

Other Notes: 2 cars are stuck there.
