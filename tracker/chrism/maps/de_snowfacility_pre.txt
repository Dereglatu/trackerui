Mission Briefing
================

Situation:
A former terroristic attack was stopped by the Counter-Terrorist team.
The Terrorists managed to infiltrate the High Secret Weapon Factory with the intention to blow up the main bridge.
Just as they have planted some T.N.T on the bridge and where ready to set it off they were eliminated by the Counter-Terrorists.

Terrorists:
You are the Backup Team. The T.N.T is still in place, you just have to plant your little bomb pack in the middle and finish this.
Alternatively you can blow up barrels containing radioactive material stored in the container room to contaminate the whole place.

Counter-Terrorists:
Just stop them like you stopped the others.
