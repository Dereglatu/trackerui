Terrorists: 
Big companies found a huge deposit of
natural ressources. It's your job to
chase away the villagers who want to 
prevent the exploitation. You can reach
this goal by destroying one of the two
water sources in this area.

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from destroying the most important water
sources. If they succeed, the whole 
ecological system will be disturbed
and the villagers will move away.
