Its seems that the terrorits have a humbug up their butt and have decided to destroy christmas once and for all! Ts are planning to destroy either the santa shop or the raindeer stables!

Cts - you must defend Christmas or else lose christmas until next year.

Ts - wipe out santa's stables or shop, whatever makes you feel bigger.


Weclome to one and all to the northpole!
